# Get started with guizero
Python is not usually the first programming language that comes to mind when you think about creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs), but there are a number of Python libraries that can simplify GUI development for Python. One of these is guizero. Like pgzero for game development, guizero abstracts away a lot of the complexity of GUI development in Python.

The examples in this repository are all contained in their own folders so you can save them individually and use them as an example or a starting point for your own projects.

While they don't duplicate any of the projects in the book, these examples did draw upon some of the projects in the book * *Create Graphical User Interfaces with Python* * by Laura Sach and Martin O'Hanlon, published by Raspberry Pi Press. You can download a PDF copy of the book for free from [The MagPi Magazine website](https://magpi.raspberrypi.com/books/create-guis) - or order a hardcopy for a very reasonable price from the [Raspberry Pi Press Store](https://store.rpipress.cc/collections/books/products/create-graphical-user-interfaces-with-python).

## First step
The first thing you'll want to do is make sure you have the guizero library installed on your computer. In most cases, you can install it from the terminal using pip.
'''
pip3 install guizero
'''
If you can't install via the terminal, there are alternative installation procedures for most popular platforms on the [guizero documentation page](https://lawsie.github.io/guizero/).

Now that you've got guizero installed, let's create our first GUI!

## Hello guizero!
